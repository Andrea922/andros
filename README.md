# Onion OS Console Renamer
A little script written in Python that allows you to rename as many consoles at once!

## Usage
0. Backup your Emu folder, first!
1. Download the zip file
2. Put the onionos-console-renamer-master folder in the Emu folder of your Onion OS
3. Run the get.bat (or python py/get.py through the console) to get the consoles' names
4. A data.xlsx file will be generated; there, in the New_label column you will set the new names for the consoles; leave blank where not needed
5. Save and close the data.xlsx file
6. Run the set.bat (or py/set.py) to update the console names!
