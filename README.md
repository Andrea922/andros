# Onion OS Console Renamer
A little script written in Python that allows you to rename as many consoles at once!
It was specifically written for [Onion OS](https://github.com/OnionUI).

## Usage
0. Backup your Emu folder, first!
1. Download the zip file
2. Put the renamer folder in the Emu folder of your Onion OS
3. Run the get.bat (or py/get.py) to get the console names
4. A data.xlsx file will be generated; there, in the New_label column you will set the new names for the consoles; leave blank where not needed
5. Save and close the data.xlsx file
6. Run the set.bat (or py/set.py) to update the console names!
